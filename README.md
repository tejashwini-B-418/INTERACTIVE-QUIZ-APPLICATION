INTERN ID:CT04DR1294

DOMAIN:FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:

This project is an Interactive Quiz Application developed as part of the Front-End Development internship at CodTech IT Solutions. The main objective of this task is to design a quiz system using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where the user can attempt questions and receive immediate feedback. The application is designed in a clean, simple, and user-friendly way, with multiple advanced features added to improve the learning experience.

The key features of the application are listed below:

• A modern and attractive home interface using glass-morphism design.

• A Start Quiz button that loads the quiz interface dynamically.

• Questions presented one at a time with four options each.

• Questions categorized into three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium and Hard.

• An adaptive difficulty system that adjusts the level based on the user’s performance.

• A timer that starts only when the user interacts with an option (Think Timer).

• A streak reward mechanism: after 3 correct answers in a row, the user earns a Hint Token.

• The Hint Token allows the user to remove one or more wrong options.

• Reaction emojis are displayed after each question based on answer and speed.

• Questions are taken from mixed domains such as HTML, CSS, JS, basics, DS and electronics.

• The application stores each response along with time, correctness, and difficulty.

• At the end of the quiz, a detailed result summary is shown to the user.

• Score, number of correct answers, weak areas, average response time, and tokens left are shown clearly.

• A difficulty progression graph is drawn using the Canvas API to display performance visually.

• A Restart button is included to reload and attempt the quiz again.

## TOOLS USED:

• **HTML5** – used for structuring all quiz elements.  
• **CSS3** – used for UI design, styling, glow effects, animations, layout and responsiveness.  
• **JavaScript (ES6)** – used for quiz logic, difficulty management, timers, hint system, reaction emojis and analytics.  
• **Canvas API** – used for drawing the difficulty progression graph.  
• **Visual Studio Code** – used as the main development environment.  
• **Git & GitHub** – used for project hosting and version control.  

## PLATFORM USED:

• **Localhost / Live Server (VS Code Extension)** for running the project.  
• **GitHub Repository** for storing, managing and submitting project code.  
• **Web Browsers (Chrome / Edge)** for testing and previewing the quiz interface.  

## APPLICATION AREAS:

This Interactive Quiz Application can be used in multiple real-world scenarios such as:

• Online learning platforms  
• Schools and college quiz systems  
• Competitive exam preparation  
• Skill assessment tools  
• Employee training programs  
• E-learning apps  
• Interview practice test platforms  
• Gamified learning systems  

## SUMMARY:

Overall, this project demonstrates practical understanding of front-end technologies and user-interface design. It shows how JavaScript can be used to create interactive, adaptive and intelligent quiz systems with real-time feedback. The work done in this task goes beyond a basic quiz and provides a complete learning experience with analytics, difficulty adjustment, and a user-friendly interface.
